# Logistic Regression

## Introduction
Logistic Regression is a statistical method for analyzing datasets in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).

## How Logistic Regression Works
Logistic Regression works by using a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. In other words, it predicts the probability of occurrence of an event by fitting data to a logistic curve. It is used extensively in the fields of medicine, biology, and social sciences, among others, for predicting outcomes such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead, etc.

The logistic function (also called the sigmoid function) can be written as:

## Getting Started
To implement Logistic Regression, you can use libraries such as scikit-learn in Python. These libraries provide efficient and easy-to-use implementations of Logistic Regression.
