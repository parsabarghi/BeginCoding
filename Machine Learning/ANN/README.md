# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Introduction
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of neuron-like units connected together to form a network that can learn and make decisions.

## How ANN Works
ANNs are composed of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons. Each neuron applies a weight and bias to its input and passes the result through an activation function. The network learns by adjusting these weights and biases to minimize the difference between its output and the desired output.

The output `f(x)` of a neuron is given by the following formula:
activation(sum of (weight_i * input_i) + bias)

## Applications
ANNs have a wide range of applications, including:
•  Image and speech recognition

•  Forecasting and data prediction

•  Medical diagnosis

•  Natural language processing
