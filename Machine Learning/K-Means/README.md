# K-Means Clustering

## Introduction
K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm used in machine learning. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to group similar data points into clusters.

## How K-Means Works
K-Means clustering aims to partition a set of observations into K clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. The algorithm follows a simple and iterative approach to assign each data point to one of the K groups based on the features that are provided.

The steps involved in K-Means clustering are:
1. Initialize K centroids randomly.
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
3. Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all points in a cluster.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence or until the end of a set number of iterations.

The objective is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), which is the sum of squared distances between each point and the centroid in a cluster.

## Applications
K-Means has a wide range of applications including:
•  Market segmentation

•  Document clustering

•  Image segmentation

•  Anomaly detection


## Getting Started
To implement K-Means clustering, you can use libraries such as scikit-learn in Python. These libraries provide efficient and easy-to-use implementations of the K-Means algorithm.
