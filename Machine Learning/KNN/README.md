# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation.

## How KNN Works
KNN works by finding the closest data points in the training set to a new data point and predicts the label based on the majority vote of its K-nearest neighbors. The distance between points is typically measured using Euclidean distance.

## Features of KNN
•  **Non-parametric**: Makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

•  **Versatile**: Works with both classification and regression problems.

•  **Easy to implement**: Requires only a simple distance calculation.

•  **Adaptable**: Can be used with various distance metrics.


## Installation
To implement KNN, you can use libraries such as scikit-learn in Python. Install it using pip:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn
