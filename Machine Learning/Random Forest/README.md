# Random Forest

## Introduction
Random Forest is a robust machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

## How Random Forest Works
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction. The algorithm introduces randomness into the model by using a random subset of features to split nodes in each decision tree. This diversity among the trees in the forest leads to a higher quality model.

## Features of Random Forest
•  Handles both classification and regression tasks.

•  Provides a good indicator of feature importance.

•  Capable of handling large datasets with higher dimensionality.

•  Can handle missing values and maintains accuracy for a large proportion of data missing.
