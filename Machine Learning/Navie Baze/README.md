# Naive Bayes

## Introduction
Naive Bayes is a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features. It is surprisingly effective and is widely used in various applications.

## How Naive Bayes Works
Naive Bayes classifiers assume that the presence (or absence) of a particular feature of a class is unrelated to the presence (or absence) of any other feature, given the class variable. This assumption simplifies the computation, and that's why it's considered "naive".

The general form of the theorem uses the following equation:
