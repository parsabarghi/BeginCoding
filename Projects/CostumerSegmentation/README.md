# Customer Segmentation Analysis

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook that performs customer segmentation analysis on a dataset of mall customers. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and group customers based on their shopping behavior and demographics.

## Features of the Analysis:
•  **Data Preprocessing:** Includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.

•  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizes univariate and bivariate analysis to understand customer demographics and spending habits.

•  **Customer Segmentation:** Employs KMeans clustering to segment customers based on 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score'.

•  **Optimal Cluster Identification:** Uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

•  **Visualization:** Provides insightful visualizations such as KDE plots, box plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to illustrate customer distributions and correlations.

•  **Model Evaluation:** Analyzes cluster centers and evaluates the model using inertia scores.


## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.
3. Execute the cells in order to replicate the analysis and view the results.

The notebook is well-commented, making it accessible for users to follow the methodology and apply similar techniques to their datasets.

## Prerequisites:
•  Python 3

•  Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
