# California House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that predicts house prices in California using a dataset of housing features. The model is built using a Random Forest Regressor and aims to provide accurate estimations of median house values based on various predictors such as location, total rooms, and proximity to the ocean.

## Features of the Model:
•  Data cleaning by dropping rows with missing values.

•  Conversion of categorical data into numerical format for model training.

•  Feature engineering to improve model performance.

•  Data normalization using StandardScaler.

•  Model evaluation using R2 score and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.


The notebook is well-documented, making it easy for users to follow along and understand the steps taken in the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation phases.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to train the model and make predictions.
