# Diabetes Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting diabetes using patient data. The model is built with Python and utilizes the RandomForestClassifier from the scikit-learn library to classify individuals based on their health metrics.

## Features of the Model:
•  **Data Preprocessing:** Handling of missing values and creation of new features to improve model accuracy.

•  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization of data correlations using heatmaps.

•  **Feature Engineering:** New features derived from existing data to provide more insights into the model.

•  **Data Normalization:** Standardization of data using StandardScaler for optimal performance.

•  **Model Training and Evaluation:** Training of the RandomForestClassifier and evaluation using accuracy score, recall score, and confusion matrix.

•  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilization of GridSearchCV for finding the best model parameters.


## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Diabetes.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.
3. Run the cells to train the model and make predictions.

The notebook is well-commented, making it easy for users to understand the process and replicate the results.

## Prerequisites:
•  Python 3

•  Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn


This model serves as a starting point for those looking to delve into medical data analysis or for healthcare professionals seeking tools to aid in early diagnosis.
